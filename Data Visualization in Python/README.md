### Description:
In this project, we'll cover the fundamentals of creating interactive plots using Plotly. The dataset collected from Seoul’s bike-sharing data to create bar plots, scatter plots, and line plots using Plotly. Along the way, we’ll explore how weather patterns in Seoul impact bike-sharing trends.

### Tools: 
Python and Excel

### Data:
Here is the dataset: ['seoul_bike_data_renamed.csv'](https://github.com/mynameisfho/My-Data-Analyst-Portofolio/blob/main/Data%20Visualization%20in%20Python/seoul_bike_data_renamed.csv).

This dataset includes hourly data on the number of public bikes rented in Seoul’s bike-sharing system. It also provides additional details about weather conditions, timing, and whether the day was a public holiday. [Source](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Seoul+Bike+Sharing+Demand).
