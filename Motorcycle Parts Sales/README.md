### Description:
The company operates three warehouses in the region, selling both retail and wholesale. They provide a wide range of parts and accept payment via credit cards, cash, and bank transfers, each of which comes with varying fees.

The board of directors seeks a deeper understanding of wholesale revenue by product line and how it fluctuates month-to-month across the different warehouses. Your task is to calculate the net revenue for each product line, grouped by month and warehouse. The results should only include orders classified as `Wholesale`.

### Tools: 
SQL and Excel

### Data:
The dataset is given, which contains a table named [`motorcycle_parts_sales.csv`](https://github.com/mynameisfho/My-Data-Analyst-Portofolio/blob/main/Motorcycle%20Parts%20Sales/motorcylce_parts_sales.csv).

| Column | Data type | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `order_number` | `VARCHAR` | Unique order number. |
| `date` | `DATE` | Date of the order, from June to August 2021. |
| `warehouse` | `VARCHAR` | The warehouse that the order was made from&mdash; `North`, `Central`, or `West`. |
| `client_type` | `VARCHAR` | Whether the order was `Retail` or `Wholesale`. |
| `product_line` | `VARCHAR` | Type of product ordered. |
| `quantity` | `INT` | Number of products ordered. | 
| `unit_price` | `FLOAT` | Price per product (dollars). |
| `total` | `FLOAT` | Total price of the order (dollars). |
| `payment` | `VARCHAR` | Payment method&mdash;`Credit card`, `Transfer`, or `Cash`. |
| `payment_fee` | `FLOAT` | Percentage of `total` charged as a result of the `payment` method. |

### Data Outputs: 
Determine the monthly `Wholesale` net revenue generated by each `product_line` for each `warehouse` in the dataset.
- Store the query as `revenue_by_product_line` in the provided SQL cell, and include the following columns:
    - `product_line`
    - `month`, displayed as `June`, `July`, and `August`
    - `warehouse`
    - `net_revenue`, calculated as the sum of `total` revenue minus the sum of `payment_fee`.
- The results should be sorted by `product_line` and `month`, with `net_revenue` in descending order.
The query output should be presented in the following format:

| `product_line` | `month` | `warehouse` |	`net_revenue` |
|----------------|-----------|----------------------------|--------------|
| product_one | --- | --- | --- |
| product_one | --- | --- | --- |
| product_one | --- | --- | --- |
| product_one | --- | --- | --- |
| product_one | --- | --- | --- |
| product_one | --- | --- | --- |
| product_two | --- | --- | --- |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
