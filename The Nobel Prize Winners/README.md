### The Nobel Prize 
has been one of the most prestigious international awards since 1901. Each year, prizes are given in chemistry, literature, physics, physiology or medicine, economics, and peace. Along with the honor, prestige, and significant prize money, winners also receive a gold medal featuring an image of Alfred Nobel (1833-1896), the founder of the prize.

The Nobel Foundation has provided a dataset of all prize winners from 1901 to 2023. This dataset, used for the project, is sourced from the Nobel Prize API and can be found in the `nobel.csv`. In this project, we have to explore and answer several questions related to the prize winning data.
