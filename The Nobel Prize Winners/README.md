### Description:
**The Nobel Prize** has been one of the most prestigious international awards since 1901. Each year, prizes are given in chemistry, literature, physics, physiology or medicine, economics, and peace. Along with the honor, prestige, and significant prize money, winners also receive a gold medal featuring an image of Alfred Nobel (1833-1896), the founder of the prize.

### Tools: 
Python and Excel

### Data:
The Nobel Foundation has provided a dataset of all prize winners from 1901 to 2023. This dataset, used for the project, is sourced from the Nobel Prize API and can be found in the [`nobel.csv`](https://github.com/mynameisfho/My-Data-Analyst-Portofolio/blob/main/The%20Nobel%20Prize%20Winners/nobel.csv).

### Data Outputs: 
In this project, we have to analyze and answer several questions related to the prize winning data.
- What gender and birth country have been awarded the most? Store the answers as string variables `top_gender` and `top_country`.
- Which decade had the highest ratio of US-born Nobel Prize winners compared to total winners across all categories? Store this as an integer variable called `max_decade_usa`.
- What decade and Nobel Prize category had the highest proportion of female laureates? Store this as a dictionary called `max_female_dict`, where the decade is the key and the category is the value (only one key-value pair should be included).
- Who was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, and in which category? Save the answers as strings named `first_woman_name` and `first_woman_category`.
- Which individuals or organizations have won the Nobel Prize more than once? Store their full names in a list called `repeat_list`.
