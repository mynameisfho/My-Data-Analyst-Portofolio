## Netflix 
which began in 1997 as a DVD rental service, has grown into one of the world's largest entertainment and media companies.

With the vast selection of movies and series available on the platform, we can exploratory data analysis and explore the entertainment industry. We suspect that the average duration of movies has been decreasing. Building on their preliminary work, we determine whether movie lengths are really getting shorter and explore any potential contributing factors.

The dataset has been provided on `netflix_data.csv`, along with a table outlining the column names and their descriptions. While the data does include some null values and outliers, dealing with these is beyond the scope of this project.
