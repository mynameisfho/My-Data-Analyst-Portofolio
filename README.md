# Data Analyst Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio!

My name is Fajar, I am a data analyst. I am proficient in SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Python, and have a good understanding of data analytics techniques including, but not limited to, data preparation, data wrangling, statistical analysis, charts design, dashboard building, process documenting, 
and data storytelling. 

In this portfolio, I have included data projects that showcase my technical skills as well as analytical capability. You will find documents, workbooks, presentation slides, and dashboards created with SQL, Tableau, Excel, Jupyter Notebook, RStudio, and PowerPoint. 
These projects demonstrate my ability to organize, analyze, and present data in a clear and visually appealing way, making it easy for anyone to understand and make informed decisions.
